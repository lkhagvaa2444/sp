# Simple Stack-based Interpreter

This project implements a simple stack-based interpreter for a custom programming language. The interpreter reads programs written in the custom language and executes them sequentially. It supports basic operations such as arithmetic, input/output, and conditional jumps.

## Features

- **Tokenization**: The interpreter tokenizes input programs into opcodes and operands.
- **Arithmetic Operations**: Supports addition and subtraction operations on a stack.
- **Input/Output**: Allows reading input from the user and printing output.
- **Conditional Jumps**: Enables branching based on conditions using conditional jump instructions.

## Usage

To use the interpreter, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare Programs**: Write programs in the custom language using the provided opcodes and syntax.
2. **Run Interpreter**: Execute the interpreter script `interpreter.py` and provide the program file as input.

```bash
python interpreter.py <program_file>
```

3. **View Output**: The interpreter will execute the program and display the output according to the program's logic.

## Example Programs

The repository includes example programs written in the custom language:

1. **Program 1**: Demonstrates simple arithmetic and conditional branching.
2. **Program 2**: Illustrates more complex control flow with conditional loops.
